#  What is a BadUSB drive?
## -> BadUSB is an attack that exploits an inherent vulnerability in USB firmware. Such an attack reprograms a USB device, causing it to act as a human interface device; once re-engineered, the USB device is used to discreetly execute commands or run malicious programs on the victim's computer.

#  How BadUSB drive works?
## -> A USB is able to connect to many different devices, including cameras, keyboards, modems, webcams, wireless networking devices, and others. Unfortunately, the way the USB is designed has yielded this BadUSB security flaw.

## The USB microcontroller chip that contains the firmware is used to identify the type of device that's connected and its capabilities. Once the firmware is compromised, it's just a matter of time until the hacker reverse engineers the USB device to insert the malicious code within the workstation. This exposes the organization to a whole range of security attacks, such as logic bombs, data theft, ransomware, and more.

#  How to avoid it?
## -> The most surefire solution to protect against BadUSB attacks would be to physically block all USB ports within the organization. However, such outdated practices end up curtailing employee productivity and impede the adoption of newer trends such as bring your own device. What every organization needs is a robust device control solution that can detect, alert, and stop nefarious actions originating from USBs, all without compromising on productivity. 


# The Only Solutions :

## There's no better way to ensure safe USB usage within your organization than by using DataSecurity Plus, the comprehensive USB device control solution.

## Prevent data theft via USB

## Block files with highly sensitive data (such as PII or ePHI) from being copied or moved to external storage devices. Report every time a file is accessed and speed up post-incident forensic analysis.

## Protect against BadUSB security attacks

## Detect potential malware intrusions, such as ransomware infections that penetrate the organization via BadUSB attacks, and send email alerts instantaneously.

## Quarantine BadUSB ransomware infections

## Isolate and cut off the corrupted workstation from the network within seconds of ransomware infection using DataSecurity Plus' automated threat response mechanism.

## Detect risky USB device usage

## Locate, track, and analyze the use of USBs across the organization and detect anomalous behavior, such as the use of a USB device during non-business hours.
